# Class Project : Exploratory and explanatory analysis
This is a class project to carry out exploratory and explanatory analysis of the dataset contained in the csv file marked "booking_of_hotel" here.

# Preamble
The hotel-booking datasets csv file is uploaded here and it awaits Exploratory Data Analysis in the open-source web application.

**Open-source web application used:** Jupyter Notebook. 

Refer to the jupyter notebook marked "Exploratory Data Analysis" which contains the codes in performing the analysis as ypu read or implement the steps below.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Exploratory Data Analysis enables one to get in-depth understanding of dataset. Typically, EDA is carried out in order to detect any errors, outliers as well as to understand different patterns in the dataset. 
In performing an EDA on "booking_of-hotel' dataset, the major steps below were carried out. Refer to the jupyter notebook marked "Exploratory Data Analysis" as you go through the steps.

**STEP 1**
Loading the libraries and importing datasets. Pandas is used in reading the csv file marked "booking_of_hotel". Open the jupyter notebook marked "Exploratory Data Analysis" to view.


**STEP 2**
We check for missing values. 

****Observation:**** From the "booking-of hotel" dataset, some data values are missing in some cells marked as "NULL". 

**STEP 3** 
Now, we visualize the missing values.

**STEP 4** 
The actual visualization of the dataset answering specific questions.

***1: Checking for the correlation between the variables***

Fiding the correlation between the variables indicates the extent to which they are related to one another. For instance, from the headmap showing the correlation, the extent to which hotel is related to the stays_in_week_nights is ...

***2: Visualizing the overall number of stays in weekend nights in each hotel using barplot***

***3: Visualizing the overall number of stays in week nights in each hotel using barplot.***

***4: Plotting scatterplot of stays in weekend nights against lead time.***

***5: Visualizing the number of stays in weekend nights for each hotel using boxplot.***

***6: Visualizing the number of stays in week nights for each hotel using boxplot.***
.
***7: To know the number of country in the dataset.***

***8: Visualizing the relationship between country and lead time (the time between the initiation 
and completion of booking process) using barchart.***

***9: Finding the relationship between stays on week and weekend nights using scatterplot.***

***10: Finding the relationship between stays on week nights and the arrival month using Boxplot.***

***11: Finding the relationship between stays on weekend nights and the arrival month using Boxplot.***


# Conclusion
The preceeding section contains the Exploratory Data Aanalysis (EDA) carried out on the "hostel_booking" dataset. 
Refer to the jupyter notebook marked "Exploratory Data Aanalysis (EDA)" while implementing the steps outlined above on your own.
