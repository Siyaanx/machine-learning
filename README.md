# Class Project : Exploratory and explanatory analysis
This is a class project to carry out explanatory and analysis of the dataset contained in the csv file marked "" here.

# Preamble
The hotel-booking datasets csv file is uploaded here and it awaits Exploratory Data Analysis in the open-source web application.
Open-source web application used: Jupyter Notebook. 
Refer to the jupyter notebook marked "Exploratory Data Analysis" which contains the codes in performing the analysis as ypu read or implement the steps below.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Exploratory Data Analysis enables one to get in-depth understanding of dataset. Typically, EDA is carried out in order to detect any errors, outliers as well as to understand different patterns in the dataset. 
In performing an EDA on "hotel-booking' dataset, these major steps were carried out.

**STEP 1**
Loading the libraries and importing datasets. Pandas is used in reading the csv file marked "hotel-booking". Open the jupyter notebook marked "Exploratory Data Analysis" to view.


**STEP 2**
We check for missing values. 

****Observation: **** From the "booking-of hotel" dataset, some data values are missing in some columns. 

**STEP 3** 
Now, we visualize the missing values.

**STEP 4** 
The actual visualization of the dataset answering specific questions.
